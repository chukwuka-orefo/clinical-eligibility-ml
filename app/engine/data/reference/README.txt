Reference Training Data

This folder contains a small, de-identified reference dataset
used to initialise the clinical eligibility engine on first run.

Purpose:
- allow the tool to train a baseline eligibility model
- support demos and offline use
- avoid dependency on restricted datasets (e.g. MIMIC)

Important:
- This data is NOT real patient data
- It is illustrative and structurally representative only
- It should not be used for clinical analysis

Analysts may replace this dataset with locally approved
extracts when retraining models.
